Environmental Data Chatbot (Privacy‑First, Local Deployment)

📖 Overview
This project is an AI‑powered chatbot designed to make environmental data (e.g., water quality, climate metrics) accessible to both scientific experts and the general public. It emphasizes privacy, transparency, and local deployment, avoiding reliance on paid APIs or external cloud services.

Built with:

LangChain for orchestration and workflow design

Ollama for running LLMs locally

Vector databases for efficient retrieval and memory management

Open‑source search tools (DuckDuckGo, SearxNG, Brave, Exa) for privacy‑friendly web queries

✨ Features
Privacy‑first architecture: All data and models run locally, with no external tracking.

Retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG): Provides context‑aware answers from scientific datasets.

Multi‑audience support: Explains data in both technical and accessible language.

Session memory management: Balances persistence, efficiency, and user control.

Modular workflows: Built with modern LangChain RunnableSequence and RunnableMap patterns.

Custom search integration: Replaces paid APIs with open‑source search engines.
